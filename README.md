## OPNsense vs. Pfsense

#### The search for the perfect firewall to protect and manage your home or work network is not a walk in the park because there are quite a variety of options in the market. However, Opnsense and Pfsense often come up in these searches. Pfsense was first released in 2006, its name was derived from its use of the packet filtering tool PF while Opnsense was developed from pfsense and was launched in 2015. From their relationship, it is clear that both programmes were made to address the same software network issues which were protection and control of the network, while providing additional features that increase functionality like web filters and supporting site to site VPNs and clients.

#### The key to choosing the best firewall is comparing it to another against your specific needs. This is because, where one fails, another redeems and vice versa which makes picking the best one a matter of professional perspective.
